# Helpscreen updated and drawn correctly
* Footsteps are now off by default
* Player starting money now defined as a server variable
	- default now set to 2500
* Due to a recession the Bank has become less generous
	- You can always withdraw all of your positive bank balance
	- If you are overdrawn the Bank is happy to extend your overdraft, but only till you
	have $500 in cash
	- If you become more than $10,000 overdrawn the Bank will not help you at all.
	- Respawning players with less than -$10k do not get 500 as they respawn.

	- the whole radar can be switched on/off with mp_radar (default is on)

+ Added management code for the Hunter/Quarry loop
* Quarries only change when:
	- at the start of the map there is a grace period where no-one has a quarry, then after a small amount of time everyone will get one
	- a Hunter kills their Quarry
	- a Quarry leaves the game (the Hunter then receives the leaving Quarry's quarry), no other Quarries change.
	- if there is only one person in the game, quarries are only changed once another player joins. Similar to map change procedure.
+ Added Authentication Manager
	- When Internet players leave server their bank balance and jail time are saved with their Steam ID
	- When Internet players rejoin a server during the same map, their original bank balance is reapplied and they are taken to jail if they had been in jail when they quit
	- This will NOT work for any players on a LAN only server
	- This will NOT work for the person who starts an Internet server
	- Reliability is subject to Steam authentication

* Added SteamID to server access log

* Increased player walk speed by 20%
* Increase AI walk speed by 20%
* On selection of a weapon you 'holster' it by default. You must then press the 'Holster' key to take out the weapon you wish to use. This prevents you from taking out a weapon when you don't mean to.

	- are not automatically removed at a quarry change
